## Summary of Findings

In the Univariate exploration of Prosper Loan Data, 
I made plently of exciting discoveries. 
Firstly I found that most of Loan status are Current status. 
Middle Class gets most of loans. 
Over 50% of loan is taken for Debt consolidation! 
Quite unexpected. 
Another interest discovery was that a 3 year loan term is the most preferred. 
And finally Credit score of 1000 is average, which is very good.
 
During the second exploration of Bivariate, 
I got more insights. Found that higher loan amount tends to have more loans of current status. 
That is, interest rates are lower on higher loan amounts. 
Debt consolidation is the higher in all status, Specially current status.
Thats some relief!. Being a Defaulter is has no excuse, 
there are defaulters even with an income of 100,000+ !! 
It's quite not clear but higher score tends to complete the loan
I see in Current Status there's more home owners.
As we can see, The current and Completed status tends to have Employed status
I see that the middle class then the rich people gets more loans specially in current Status.
the more investors we have the more completed loans we get.
there's higher Estimated return with defaulted and charged off Loans Status,
So the higher return involved with higher Loan risk


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, 
I will introduce the key variables of the dataset including but not limited to Loan Status, 
Interst rate, Creadit score, term, etc. Then after that,
I will show how each of these variables affect each other 
and also how they are related or how much they are dependent on other not so known factors like Delinquencies, 
Debt-to-income ration, credit lines, credit utilization etc.
